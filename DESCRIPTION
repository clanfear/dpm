Description: Implements the models described by Allison, Williams, and
 Moral-Benito (2017) in R. This class of models uses structural equation 
 modeling to specify dynamic (lagged dependent variable) models with 
 fixed effects for panel data. Additionally, models may have predictors
 that are only weakly exogenous, i.e., are affected by prior values of 
 the dependent variable.
